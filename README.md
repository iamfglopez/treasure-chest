This chest contains my most-valued projects, etc. 

Hello there! My name is Frietz Lopez, and I'm interested in the field of data science and back-end dev.
I'm still new to programming (Total newwwbb). I'm currently learning as of the python and hopefully to get accustomed to the language within a few weeks or months.
